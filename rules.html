                <h2>General Information</h2>
                <p>We, the entire Zenith Staff Team, want to make sure that everyone on our Discord server and Minecraft
                    server has a safe and fair experience. To achieve this, we have to set strict rules to which
                    everyone has to adhere to.</p>
                <p>Breaking the rules will result in a (temporary) loss of the ability to chat or even speak. A lack of
                    knowledge about the rules won't save you from punishment and will be treated as a mistake from your
                    side.</p>
